Description: Framework for creating massively concurrent network applications in Python.
 It takes a Lightweight-tasks-with-message-passing approach to concurrency.
 The goal of Concurrence is to provide an easier programming model for writing
 high performance network applications than existing solutions (Multi-threading,
 Twisted, asyncore etc). Concurrence uses Lightweight tasks in combination with
 libevent to expose a high-level synchronous API to low-level asynchronous IO.
