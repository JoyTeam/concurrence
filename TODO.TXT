0.3.2:

./lib/concurrence/io/buffered.py:            #TODO!!! handle exception case/exit
- finish memcache client
- implement channel preference and see if this helps for memcache http://www.stackless.com/pipermail/stackless/2009-March/003970.html
- try to improve 'fill-rate' of memcache comms, e.g. less flushing, maybe client API must be changed to provide highest rate, check bandwith vs latency
- check and finish timeout stuff (rethink global constant, check that all constants are used properly e.g. TIMEOUT_CURRENT vs TIMEOUT_NEVER
- increase test coverage
- update documentation (check examples)

0.4:
    - deprecate SocketServer (Socket.server is better (less magical))
    - rethink Message, allow everything as message?
    - check all clients/servers for use of bufferedstream, can they use shared buffers?
    - remove dummy threading stuff
    - deprecate/remove xmpp stuff, not good enough, maybe later
    - deprecate/remove Connector and Server classes?
