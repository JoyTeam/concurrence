Installing Concurrence
======================

The quick and easy way
----------------------
Here we assume you want install Concurrence for use with 'Normal Python' as opposed to 'Stackless Python'. 
This is the easiest way to get started with Concurrence. Later you may want to try out Stackless because it
delivers a bit better performance (typicaly about 10-25% faster).
We will be using `setup tools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ to install all dependencies.

Note that Linux users might need to make sure they are running as root, or prefix the commands with 'sudo'.

First we need to install `Pyrex <http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex>`_::

    easy_install pyrex 

Next we will install concurrence::

    easy_install concurrence

If might give an error: Setup script exited with error: SandboxViolation: ... 
This is a known problem with Pyrex, please do::

    python -c "from Pyrex.Compiler import Scanning;Scanning.get_lexicon()"

And then try install concurrence again

Finally we need to install the `Greenlet package <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/greenlet>`_:: 

    easy_install greenlet

If you run into compiler problems on Linux, this is most probably caused by missing development headers
for Python and or libevent. On Ubuntu these packages can be installed using::

    apt-get install python-dev
    apt-get install libevent-dev

If you run into compiler problems on OSX, this is most probably casued by missing libevent and or its headers

   1. `Download latest stable release of libevent <http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent>`_.
   2. Unzip and cd into the libevent directory
   3. Run ./configure && make
   4. Run sudo make install
   5. Try installing concurrence again

That should be it!, you should now be able to start playing with the examples

Optional dependencies
---------------------

If you want to use the simple web framework included with Concurrence, you need to install
`Routes <http://routes.groovie.org>`_ and `WebOb <http://pythonpaste.org/webob>`_::

    easy_install routes  
    easy_install webob

If you use Python2.5, you might want to install 'simplejson' as well::

    easy_install simplejson


Running the examples
--------------------
First make sure you have the source distibution of Concurrence::

    svn checkout http://concurrence.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ concurrence

The examples can be found in the examples directory and are documented on the Concurrence
website at http://opensource.hyves.org/concurrence

Installing stackless
--------------------
If you want to run Concurrence on top of stackless (which is a bit faster), you will need to
install Stackless Python.
Download the latest stackless tarball from www.stackless.com. unpack it somewhere (/tmp/stackless), and execute
the folowing commands:

UBUNTU:
Make sure you have <libreadline-dev> package. Otherwise you have no history support in the python interactive shell
(on ubuntu: apt-get install libreadline-dev)

We will install stackless in /opt/stackless using the prefix argument to configure. This will prevent any existing python installation
from being overwritten::

    UBUNTU:
	    ./configure --prefix=/opt/stackless --with-readline --with-zlib=/usr/include
	    make
	    make install

    OSX (Leopard):
	    ./configure --prefix=/opt/stackless --enable-framework --enable-stacklessfewerregisters --with-readline --with-zlib=/usr/include
	    echo '#define SETPGRP_HAVE_ARG' >> pyconfig.h
	    make
	    make install

I always like to make a symlink to stackless for everyday usage and to differentiate it from 'normal' python:
 
ln -s /opt/stackless/bin/python2.5 /usr/bin/stackless
